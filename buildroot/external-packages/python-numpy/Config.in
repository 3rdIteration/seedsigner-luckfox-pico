	  NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing
	  with Python.

	  This is a custom build of NumPy 1.24.3, which works with
	  GCC >= 8.0 (compatible with LuckFox GCC 8.3.0).

	  The standard buildroot python-numpy is version 1.25.0 which
	  requires GCC >= 8.4, which is not available in the LuckFox
	  toolchain.

	  Built without BLAS/LAPACK for simplicity on embedded systems.
